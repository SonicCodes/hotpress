# HotPress ðŸ”¥ - Hot Reloading for ExpressJs
## Philosophy
- Why should you restart a http server just for a small change in your source code. isn't HTTP meant to be stateless.
- Aren't you meant to have a static fetch-once properties for development.

If you agree with those philosophies, then you'll love HotPress. 

What HotPress does is that it only initializes the server and required parameters once and pass it to your virtual server (Router).

## Usage
```shell
npm install @soniccodes/hotpress
```

#### ./foo.js - The reloadable file
```js
/**
  @param server : Router
**/
function reload(server) {
   server.get("/hi",function(req, res){
       res.send("hi")
   })
   //Anything you'd do with a normal server.  
}
modules.export = reload //This is very important
```

#### server.js 
```js
const express = require("express")
const {setup,reload} = require("@soniccodes/hotpress")
const app = express()
setup({server:app,reloadable:"./foo.js"})
app.listen(port,(err)=>{
   if(err) throw err;
   console.log("âš¡ Ready on http://localhost:"+port);
})
```
